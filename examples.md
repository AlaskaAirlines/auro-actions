# Workflow Usage Examples

Below are examples of how to call each reusable workflow from another repository. Replace `main` with a specific tag or branch if needed.

**Note**: Some workflows require secrets to be passed. Make sure your repository has the necessary secrets configured:

- **NPM_TOKEN**: Required for workflows that publish to npm
- **AURO_SURGE_TOKEN**: Required for workflows that deploy to Surge
